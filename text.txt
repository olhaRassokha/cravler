Johnson is good at suggesting a timid teen beneath his wall of muscle. Gillan seems believably unsure of herself as the nerd Martha, while also making exposed abs look classy.
This Jumanji is a passable time-waster, the equivalent of comfort food dished up for the holidays.
You may ask: Though good for an initial laugh, how long can this wrong-body comedy shtick pay off? The answer: pretty much the entire movie.
The performances by Mr. Johnson, Mr. Hart and Mr. Black seem informed by the conviction that if they amuse themselves, they will also amuse others. They are not entirely wrong, but they are also not sufficiently right.
If you're going to coast on charm, you could do a lot worse than Dwayne Johnson.
A big-budget follow-up that doesn't unreel like a lazy money grab is a victory in of itself. Everybody wins this game.
With its video game upgrade, "Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle" manages to match the silly fun of its predecessor - even without Williams - and that's no small achievement unlocked.
Their cognitive dissonance is what gives Jumanji its humor, and the film relies on the star personas of Johnson, Hart, Black and Gillan to deliver it.
This sequel turns out to be a comedy of manners, of all things, and an agreeable one, a movie that will get you laughing and suck you in.
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle turns out to be surprisingly fun, infusing the premise with a The Breakfast Club twist while accentuating the comedy.
It manages to pull off something I once would have thought was impossible: It makes the original Jumanji look like a beloved cinema classic.
It's supposed to be a video-ized board game come to life, but really, it's just a bored game.
